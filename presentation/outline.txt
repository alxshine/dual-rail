introduction:
  - power analysis attacks
    > requirements:
      - power model
      - data dependency
    > basics:
      - cpa
    > defenses:
      - masking
      - dual rail
  - llvm?

outline:
  - general idea of balancing
  - components:
    > replacement arithmetic
    > llvm
    > qemu

current status:
  - what is done
    > arithmetic
      - show example (sub?)
    > qemu evaluation
    > llvm toolchain
      - skeleton for pass
      - show build steps
  - first results
    > histograms of manual
    > what can be balanced

next steps:
  - write balancing pass for 8bit arithmetic
  - find a way for multi-limb arithmetic
  - better performance for multiply and modulo
