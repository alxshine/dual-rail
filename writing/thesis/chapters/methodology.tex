\section{Methodology}
\label{methodology}
This section describes the goals and general approach of my thesis project.

\subsection{Arithmetic}
The largest caveat of finding a balanced arithmetic was that $\neg{x \circ y}$ is not $\neg{x} \circ \neg{y}$ ($\circ$ here denotes any operator).
As the ALU cannot execute two different operations on parts of the same register at the same time, this means that there \emph{must} be imbalanced temporary values during execution.
My goal then is to limit the number of these imbalanced values.
