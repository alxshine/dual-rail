There are multiple approaches to performing a \poweranalysis{} attack.

Currently there are is no perfect defense against such an attack, and all current defenses do is increase the amount of effort required for successful attack.

\poweranalysis{} is made possible by processed data directly affecting the power consumption.
Defensive measures then either try to insert additional factors for the power consumption, or decrease the signal-to-noise ratio of the power consumption itself (by reducing variance in the power consumption).

One popular class of defense that introduces additional factors is masking
