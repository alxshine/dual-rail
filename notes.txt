some operations happen in target/arm/helper.c:
-address translation: get_phys_addr

The operations happen in tcg/tcg-op.c where I can check the operands
Load/store happens in tcg_gen_ldst_op_... the rest is easily findable by name

TCGv_i32_d
there is a function that dumps all registers (tcg_dump_ops), I can probably learn how to access values from there
it in turn uses tcg_get_arg_str to generate the actual output line from the argument pointer


SUCCESS
all operations are created in tcg_gen_op2, registers and memory are pointers (still need to find out which is which) and immediates are their actual values
I can correlate this with the dump list

The execution should be somewhere that accesses the memory for all the QTAILQ stuff.
This is probably just the translation thread, the execution thread is somewhere else.
